## Origin and Current Adventure 🌍

Originally from Venezuela, I'm Glendys, but you can call me Glen. My journey led me to Canada, where I embraced the world of technology. Now, I'm embarking on a new adventure to the Netherlands with my little family. Join me as I navigate through life's exciting chapters.

## Tech Journey 🚀

My tech story began in 2007, and it's been an incredible ride since then. I spent three years at Universidad de Oriente in Maturin, diving into the world of system engineering. Later, I expanded my skills at Conestoga College, specializing in Computer Programming and Analysis.

## Passionate Pursuits 🌟

Beyond the world of code, I have a sweet spot for ice cream – it's my guilty pleasure! Dancing brings rhythm to my life, photography captures my moments, and writing allows me to express my thoughts and reflections.
